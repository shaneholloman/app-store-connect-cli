# AGENTS.md

Unofficial, fast, lightweight, agent-assisted, reviewer-owned CLI for the App Store Connect API. Built in Go with [ffcli](https://github.com/peterbourgon/ff).

## Skills

Skills for using `asc` in app workflows live at https://github.com/rorkai/app-store-connect-cli-skills.

Repository-maintainer workflows live under `.agents/skills/`:

- `$develop-asc-change`: design, implement, and verify commands, flags, endpoints, bug fixes, and behavior-changing refactors.
- `$audit-asc-pr`: audit a complete PR and fix proven defects.
- `$watch-asc-pr`: recheck PR comments, checks, head changes, and merge readiness.
- `$triage-asc-issue`: reproduce, classify, label, and scope an issue.
- `$review-wall-of-apps-prs`: validate, approve, and merge Wall of Apps submissions safely.
- `$release-asc-cli`: publish and verify an end-to-end CLI repository release.
- `$sync-asc-skills`: check the external ASC workflow skills for CLI-surface drift.

Use these skills for their matching workflows instead of expanding this always-loaded file with task-specific procedures.

## Core CLI contract

- Use long-form flags in docs, tests, and examples (`--app`, `--output`).
- Output defaults are TTY-aware: `table` in terminals and minified `json` for pipes or CI. Explicit `--output` wins.
- Do not add interactive prompts. Require `--confirm` for destructive operations.
- Use `--paginate` when callers request every page.
- Write data to stdout and errors or diagnostics to stderr.
- Never accept and silently ignore an unsupported flag or value.
- JSON output shape is part of the command contract: reads of ASC collections/resources print Apple's envelope unmodified; mutation receipts and computed results use exported camelCase structs in internal/asc/output_*.go with a registered renderer; added fields are additive and removals follow the stability ladder.

## Discover current behavior

Never rely on memorized command shapes. Before implementing, testing, or documenting a command, inspect its current help:

```bash
asc --help
asc builds --help
asc builds list --help
```

For App Store Connect API documentation, prefer the `sosumi.ai` mirror over `developer.apple.com`.

Use the offline OpenAPI snapshot for endpoint and schema truth:

- `docs/openapi/latest.json`: complete snapshot.
- `docs/openapi/paths.txt`: quick endpoint index.
- `docs/openapi/README.md`: update procedure.

Validate attributes against the exact create or update request schema. Validate filters and includes against the specific endpoint; related top-level and relationship endpoints often differ.

## Development workflow

- Work on a branch and use an isolated worktree when the main checkout is dirty or other work is in progress.
- Do not push directly to `main`, bypass hooks, use `--no-verify`, or skip checks to force a result.
- Use TDD for behavior changes: reproduce or establish RED, implement the smallest coherent change, then reach GREEN.
- Keep one logical change per commit. Do not mix unrelated refactors, fixes, and test rewrites.
- Preserve additive PR history. Do not squash, rebase, force-push, or otherwise rewrite commits unless the user explicitly requests that strategy.
- Re-run the focused failing test after each fix before broad validation.
- Preserve and report pre-existing failures honestly.
- Parallelize independent read-only investigation and validation, using isolated subagents when available. Do not let agents concurrently edit the same branch, files, or command group. Keep edits, pushes, review replies and resolutions, approvals, merges, releases, and cleanup coordinated and serialized.

User-facing commands and flags follow `experimental` -> `stable` -> `deprecated` -> `removed`. Do not delete stable behavior directly. Deprecations require warning text, transition tests, migration guidance, and a release-note entry.

## Implementation invariants

- Put command implementations in `internal/cli/<domain>` and register new top-level commands in `internal/cli/registry/registry.go`.
- Set `UsageFunc: shared.DefaultUsageFunc` on command groups and subcommands.
- Use `shared.ContextWithTimeout` or `shared.ContextWithUploadTimeout` for outbound HTTP.
- Read and write repository-controlled or API-supplied paths through `internal/rootfs`, anchored to the operator-selected root for that command, instead of plain `os` file operations.
- Validate required flags before side effects and assert stderr messages in tests.
- Use `internal/cli/cmdtest` for CLI-level coverage and `httptest` for HTTP payload coverage.
- Remove shared wrappers or helpers made obsolete by a refactor.

## Build and validation

```bash
make build
make format
make check-docs
make lint
ASC_BYPASS_KEYCHAIN=1 make test
make install-hooks
```

Every manual test command must use `ASC_BYPASS_KEYCHAIN=1` to prevent host keychain prompts and profile bleed-through. The `make test` target enforces the same environment internally.

Before opening or merging a substantive behavior PR, run `make build`, `make format`, `make check-docs`, `make lint`, and `ASC_BYPASS_KEYCHAIN=1 make test`. If command help changed, run `make generate-command-docs` and commit `docs/COMMANDS.md` before those checks. For a narrowly scoped documentation or skill change, run `make check-docs`, which includes the repository and skill validators, instead of the full Go suite unless the changed surface or repository policy requires more. For a Wall-only PR, run `make check-wall-of-apps` on the exact head.

Require GitHub-required checks before merge, but do not wait for advisory or otherwise non-required CI jobs. Inspect and report relevant advisory failures without treating pending or unrelated jobs as blockers.

Do not weaken CI: formatting, documentation, lint, and tests must run on PR and `main` workflows.

## GitHub and issue guardrails

- Inspect thread-aware GitHub review state before declaring a PR clean; flat comments do not prove every thread is resolved.
- A PR is ready only when the latest head was reviewed, required checks pass, required reviews are satisfied, actionable threads are resolved, and GitHub reports it mergeable.
- If `main` advances, recheck the exact PR head, merge-base diff, duplicate or overlap risk, review threads, required checks, and mergeability against current `main` without changing the branch. Do not update, rebase, or merge `main` into a clean PR merely to refresh its base. Update a branch only when GitHub already reports an actual merge conflict, or when an explicitly authorized merge attempt made with every readiness gate passing is refused under strict up-to-date branch protection. Never bypass branch protection with an admin merge.
- When the user says to loop, babysit, or continue until green, keep re-fetching the exact head's required checks, required reviews, thread-aware review state, and mergeability. Fix valuable new feedback in additive commits, push, and repeat until the PR is clean or a material blocker requires user input; pending required CI or reviews are intermediate states. Advisory CI may remain pending only after every other clean-state gate passes.
- When merge is explicitly authorized, preserve the PR commits with a regular merge commit, for example `gh pr merge <number> --merge --match-head-commit <sha>`. Do not squash unless the user explicitly requests squash for that PR.
- Fix-forward is the default for `$audit-asc-pr`; approval and merge still require explicit user intent.
- Every newly created or triaged issue must end with exactly one type (`bug`, `enhancement`, `question`), one priority (`p0`-`p3`), and one difficulty (`easy`, `medium`, `hard`) label.

## Authentication and live testing

App Store Connect API keys come from https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/integrations/api and must never be committed.

Tests touching auth must isolate relevant environment and config state. For live verification, prefer read-only calls. When mutation is necessary during PR audits, prefer disposable app `6759231657`, clean up temporary resources, and record anything left behind. Never mutate a non-disposable app without explicit approval.

## Handoff contract

For substantial changes, explain the chosen approach, alternatives and trade-offs, expected invocations and outputs, compatibility impact, edge cases, failure modes, commands run, tests, live verification, commits or pushes, and unresolved risks.
