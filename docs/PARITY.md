# Parity map

Lookup table for remaining fastlane/ASC parity after the 2026-08-30 backlog
(#2227–#2236) and the 2026-09-02 web-session issues. Command claims were
checked against a built `asc` binary's `--help`. Live inventory:
`asc capabilities` (use `--status web-session` for web-only rows). Do not
duplicate that catalog here.

Each area is exactly one of: covered by a command, tracked by issue(s), or an
intentional non-goal. Do not copy this file into `AGENTS.md`.

## Remaining areas

| Area | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| App creation plus Developer Portal service associations as one end-to-end flow | **Intentional non-goal.** No single end-to-end command. Compose `asc web apps create` with `asc web bundle-ids`. Remaining identifier/services/iCloud work is #2290. |
| Metadata, screenshots, preview videos, binary, and submission as one operation | **Intentional non-goal.** Separate commands by design. Closest composed paths: `asc publish appstore` (IPA or local build, optional metadata, optional submit) and `asc release stage` (metadata, attach, validate). Screenshots and preview videos stay `asc screenshots` and `asc video-previews`. Chain with `asc workflow`. |
| Simulator creation, booting, app installation, and screenshot capture beyond the bounded matrix in #2230 | **Intentional non-goal.** `asc screenshots run` and default iOS `asc screenshots capture` require a booted simulator and an installed app. `asc screenshots capture --provider macos` captures a running macOS app. `asc xcode install` targets a connected physical device, not a simulator. Bounded matrix capture is #2230. Create/boot/clone/delete stay on host Simulator/`simctl`. |
| Test configuration and reporting beyond the first `asc xcode test` slice (#2227) | **Intentional non-goal.** First slice shipped as `asc xcode test` (`test`, `build-for-testing`, `test-without-building`, destinations, test plans, filters, result bundle, JUnit via `--report junit --report-file PATH`). Further scan-style knobs stay `--xcodebuild-flag` unless demand appears. |
| Web-session-only capabilities with no public Apple API | **Tracked by** open 2026-09-02 web-session issues: #2275, #2278, #2283, #2284, #2286, #2287, #2288, #2290, #2291, #2292, #2293, #2294, #2295, #2297, #2298, #2299, #2300, #2301. Shipped the same day (do not reopen): #2268, #2269, #2271, #2272, #2274, #2277, #2280, #2281, #2289, #2296. Shipped inventory: `asc capabilities --status web-session`. |
| Android tooling, plugin/lane runtime, chat connectors, documentation generators, obsolete actions | **Intentional non-goal.** See list below. |

## Intentional non-goals

Unless user demand appears, do not build:

- Android tooling (Play/Gradle/supply). `asc android-ios-mapping` is Apple's Android-to-iOS mapping API, not Android CI.
- Plugin/lane runtime (Fastfile plugins). `asc workflow` runs repo-local steps; it is not a plugin host.
- Chat notification connectors beyond existing `asc notify slack` (incoming webhook): Mailgun, Chatwork, IFTTT, Flock, desktop notifications.
- Documentation generators (API/doc-site generators, fastlane docs plugins). `asc docs` / `asc init` are CLI reference helpers.
- Obsolete actions Apple or fastlane have already retired.
