# App Store Connect API 4.4.1 coverage ledger

## Objective

Deliver production-ready CLI support for every behavior added or changed by App
Store Connect API 4.4.1 without silently changing the ID or lifecycle semantics
of existing stable commands. Schema-only support is acceptable only when the
ledger below records an evidence-backed reason that a first-class command is not
useful.

The work was split into stacked, independently reviewable pull requests based
on the 4.4.1 schema update. Each behavior PR used RED-GREEN tests, verified a
freshly built binary, and passed the complete repository gate before review.

## Source contract

The coverage ledger is derived from three independent views of the contract:

1. Apple's App Store Connect API 4.4.1 release notes.
2. Apple's official OpenAPI zip, independently downloaded and compared
   byte-for-byte with `docs/openapi/latest.json`.
3. A semantic diff from the original repository 4.4 snapshot commit to 4.4.1,
   plus a second diff from the immediate pre-PR repository snapshot so work
   already reconciled after the 4.4 import is not counted twice.

## Current effort and status

The CLI pull requests landed sequentially after exact-head audit. Each behavior
PR passed its exact-head gates before merge. The final behavior integration at
`48e0d003` also passed its post-merge Main Branch, Govulncheck, and CodeQL
workflows. No App Store Connect API 4.4.1 behavior PR remains open:

The hard audit fixed contract gaps beyond the initial six implementation PRs:
endpoint-exact fields, includes, sparse fields, and relationship limits; opaque
continuation URLs; next-aware argument
exclusivity; review-response links and metadata; positional-argument rejection;
age-rating prerequisite declarations; adjusted-equalization required filters;
exact deprecation warnings and migration guidance; and rendered parent-help
discoverability for all 29 deprecated leaves. A post-merge thread audit found
the final transitive age-rating contradiction omitted by #1782; #1788 added
both sparse-update regression cases, landed green, and closed that thread.

The later cross-verification found one remaining typed-request gap: seven
properties marked optional and nullable by OpenAPI could represent omission and
a value, but not explicit JSON `null`. #1792 is the first implementation to
preserve all three states for `socialMedia`, `socialMediaAgeRestricted`, the two
v2 localization `description` properties, v2 group-localization
`customAppName`, and the two v2 image `uploaded` properties. Its exact audited
final PR head is
`3f7d14495fcb3b696692bee4955e36fd2f36c63f`. That head also preserves the
legacy omission behavior for a whitespace-only `customAppName` while retaining
explicit JSON `null`; it landed on `main` as
`804624cd158d1eb8843d8e0be7cf55bc639da0a1`.

The fully merged behavior integration is #1796 at `main` commit
`48e0d003ebde8d2046b0a19463526c95c3bc25e4`; #1789 previously landed this
coverage ledger at `d6d8d94b`, test-only #1790 landed at `73466720`,
docs-only #1791 landed at `e902d375`, and nullable-fidelity #1792 landed at
`804624cd`; IAP sparse-field #1793 landed at `f6b34d9e`, and
subscription/pricing sparse-field #1795 landed at `5bf2d154`. The 37-path,
47-operation, 47-schema, 102-direct, 71-transitive, 173-contract,
61-modified-schema, and 9-addition/7-deprecation counts are unchanged. The
recursive built-help comparison from `839c4da6` to `9282e82d` found 48 added
and 52 changed leaf paths, 100 affected paths total, with zero removals; it is
historical help-surface evidence rather than the nullable request-encoding
proof, which is carried by #1792's typed tests.

PR `#1796` was audited at exact final head
`8b4821a4529ae3a257dc56945a67dbef0ab7ac6b` and landed as
`48e0d003ebde8d2046b0a19463526c95c3bc25e4`, completing all eight app-info,
age-rating, and Xcode Cloud sparse-query transports. No behavior follow-up
remains open.

## Live App Store Connect verification

All manual commands used `ASC_BYPASS_KEYCHAIN=1` and the disposable app
`6759231657`. The exact 4.4.1 path delta was exercised against the live service:

| Domain | Operations | Live result |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| IAP versions, localizations, and images | 18 | All added operations received a successful live response |
| Subscription versions, localizations, and images | 18 | All added operations received a successful live response |
| Subscription-group versions and localizations | 10 | All added operations received a successful live response |
| Adjusted equalizations | 1 | Successful with the required upfront price point and plan type |
| **Total** | **47** | **29 GET, 8 POST, 5 PATCH, and 5 DELETE operations on 37 paths** |

The live run covered version creation and readback, localization CRUD, complete
image reserve/upload/commit/read/delete lifecycles, relationship endpoints, and
pagination. A subscription-group version review item was added, updated, and
removed. IAP and subscription version-item attempts reached Apple and returned
the expected readiness rejection because the throwaway products lacked review
prerequisites; no review submission was submitted. All four current
`READY_FOR_REVIEW` submissions contained zero items at closeout.

Live behavior refined five schema-level assumptions:

- Adjusted equalizations succeed only when both an upfront price point and
  `--plan-type MONTHLY` are supplied. #1783 now enforces both before HTTP.
- Setting `socialMediaAgeRestricted=true` required
  `userGeneratedContent=true`, `ageAssurance=true`, and `socialMedia=true`.
  #1782 and #1788 reject all 25 sparse flag combinations that are provably
  contradictory without reading stored state. All four attributes were
  restored to `false` afterward.
- Apple rejects empty and explicit JSON-null descriptions for IAP-version and
  subscription-version localizations even though OpenAPI marks the attribute
  nullable. Non-empty PATCH requests succeed; the CLI retains schema-correct
  encoding while the docs and skills record the live restriction.
- Five retained validator v1 reads returned the same IDs for v2-created group
  localizations, subscription localizations, and subscription images. A runtime
  validator migration was therefore a live-verified no-op, not an assumption.
- Apple production returned `400` for the official
  `fields[appInfos]=kidsAgeBand` selector on app-info detail and collection
  reads. The CLI retains the published 4.4.1 contract and records this as an
  upstream rollout lag. The other new app-carried IAP/subscription-group and
  age-rating sparse fields returned `200`; the disposable app has no Xcode
  Cloud product, so that transport remains deterministically HTTP-tested.

PR #1792 made no new live explicit-null claim. It added typed-client fidelity and
table-driven omit/value/null encoding tests only. The existing CLI commands
continue to send the same concrete values or omissions as before; they do not
gain a new clear/null flag. No explicit-null request for the age-rating, group
localization, or image-upload fields was sent to App Store Connect for #1792,
and the earlier live rejection of null localization descriptions remains the
only live null evidence.

Cleanup was verified by ID. Image resources, secondary localizations, review
items, and temporary group-version resources were deleted where the API permits
it. All four review submissions were empty at closeout.

| Resource | Cleanup result |
| --- | --- |
| IAP parent `6791819283` | Deleted |
| IAP version `07d9113f-2a96-43d0-8399-914deeaa49d4` | Remains orphaned; Apple exposes no version DELETE and parent deletion did not cascade |
| IAP localization `0073ad1d-879d-41f4-bb7d-49c73f0479b5` | Remains because Apple rejects deletion of the final required localization |
| Subscription group `22243347` and subscription `6791819604` | Deleted |
| Subscription version `6f861af5-23c9-4e3c-807a-9879220c051f` | Remains orphaned |
| Subscription localization `9fc52d69-2eed-440c-8053-0646de35daa8` | Remains because it is the final required localization |
| Group `22243440` and all version/localization descendants | Deleted or cascaded; verified gone |
| Validator-test group `22243740` and its group-version/group-localization descendants | Deleted; verified gone |
| Validator-test subscription `6791895240` | Deleted |
| Subscription version `1dcba57e-f03f-49e0-a24e-d048fb6dd479` | Remains orphaned |
| Subscription localization `67326a94-973a-4061-a991-dc7061018232` | Remains because it is the final required localization |

These six retained version/localization resources are confined to the disposable
app. No presigned upload URL, credential, or non-disposable app data is recorded.

After every CLI behavior change was merged, a final read-only smoke with the
locally built exact-`main` `48e0d003` CLI re-read app
`6759231657`, its full age-rating declaration, all four review submissions,
every submission's items, and all retained resource IDs. The app read
succeeded; `userGeneratedContent`, `ageAssurance`, `socialMedia`, and
`socialMediaAgeRestricted` were all `false`; every submission returned no
items; all six retained resources remained readable; and every parent or
container recorded as deleted still returned not found. The subsequent
skills-only #52 help-path correction did not change CLI or live behavior.

## Definition of done

- Every added operation below is implemented and tested, or marked schema-only
  with a concrete rationale.
- Every one of the 102 modified existing operations is classified as a new
  query/response behavior, a deprecation reversal, or a change already covered
  before the schema PR.
- All 71 schema-mediated operation-contract changes that are not direct
  path-item diffs are classified separately. Two change request contracts; all
  71 change response contracts through referenced schemas.
- All 47 added and 61 modified schemas decode and encode through typed models
  where user-facing behavior depends on them, or have an explicit schema-only
  disposition.
- The three new version resource types can be created, listed, viewed, and
  submitted through discoverable CLI commands.
- Version-scoped localization and image workflows support create, read, update,
  delete, pagination, and uploads where the API permits them.
- Existing product-ID and group-ID commands retain their current behavior until
  they have an explicit deprecation warning, migration command, and transition
  tests. A version ID is never silently substituted for a product or group ID.
- `asc schema` exposes relationship fields needed to construct relationship-only
  requests, and CI fails when either generated schema index is stale.
- Command documentation, API notes, migration guidance, and external workflow
  skills reflect the final command surface.
- Focused tests, adjacent tests, built-binary checks, the full repository gate,
  GitHub checks, and appropriate live verification are green on each latest PR
  head.

The review-submission relationship for `subscriptionVersion` modifies the
existing `/v1/reviewSubmissionItems` operation.

### Subscription-group versions and localizations: 10

| Method | Path | Required behavior | Disposition | Owner | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| `DELETE` | `/v2/subscriptionGroupLocalizations/{id}` | Delete a localization with confirmation | Implemented typed command | #1780 | `48d04e0b`; confirmation and HTTP tests |

The review-submission relationship for `subscriptionGroupVersion` modifies the
existing `/v1/reviewSubmissionItems` operation.

### Version review-submission coverage

All three types use `POST /v1/reviewSubmissionItems` with required
`reviewSubmission.data` plus exactly one version relationship. The discoverable
generic command is `asc review items add --submission "SUBMISSION_ID"
--item-type "TYPE" --item-id "VERSION_ID"`; domain-specific submit shortcuts
may delegate to the same typed client after their ID semantics are explicit.

| Version type | Relationship payload | `--item-type` | Required test evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IAP | `inAppPurchaseVersion.data.type=inAppPurchaseVersions` | `inAppPurchaseVersions` | HTTP body test plus built command test | Implemented in #1777 at `ee40c7b3` and cross-verified in #1781 at `aba35e0a` |
| Subscription | `subscriptionVersion.data.type=subscriptionVersions` | `subscriptionVersions` | HTTP body test plus built command test | Implemented in #1781 at `aba35e0a` |
| Subscription group | `subscriptionGroupVersion.data.type=subscriptionGroupVersions` | `subscriptionGroupVersions` | HTTP body test plus built command test | Implemented in #1781 at `aba35e0a` |

The exact directly modified-operation checklist includes the four
review-submission read operations whose sparse fields and includes gain the
three version relationships. The `POST` request change is schema-mediated and
is tracked separately below because the operation object itself is unchanged.

### Subscription adjusted equalizations: 1

| Method | Path | Required behavior | Disposition | Owner | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/v1/subscriptionPricePoints/{id}/adjustedEqualizations` | List adjusted equalized price points using the exact territory, subscription, upfront-price-point, and plan-type filters supported by this operation | Implemented typed command | #1778 | `39284b0a`; exact query/response, strict CSV/enums, territory inclusion, opaque-next, ID validation, aggregation, and conflict tests |

## Modified existing contract ledger

The original 4.4-to-4.4.1 diff modifies 102 existing operations. Fifty remain
different from the immediate pre-PR repository snapshot and expand query or
response contracts. The other 52 were already reconciled in the repository
after the original 4.4 import: 44 reverse OpenAPI `deprecated: true` flags and
eight add media-localization sparse-field parameters. Each item remains in the
checklist so "already covered" is an audited disposition rather than an omitted
change.

| Contract area | Semantic change | Verification owner | Exact evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IAP reads | `fields[inAppPurchases]` gains `versions`; IAP detail and app-IAP collection reads gain `include=versions`, `fields[inAppPurchaseVersions]`, and `limit[versions]` | #1777, #1793, and #1796 | `ee40c7b3`; #1793 final head `917d719d`, landed as `f6b34d9e`, adds all 11 propagated IAP/promoted-purchase GETs; #1796 final head `8b4821a4`, landed as `48e0d003`, adds the three app and CI-product transports |
| Subscription reads | Subscription detail and group-subscription reads gain version includes, sparse fields, and relationship limits; subscription sparse fields gain `versions` across related endpoints | #1779 and #1795 | `c8f3ab52`; #1795 final head `229dc07c`, landed as `5bf2d154`, adds exact query, stable owner selection, opaque-pagination, and compatibility tests across all 17 propagated subscription/pricing GETs |
| Subscription-group reads | Group detail and app-group collection reads gain version includes, sparse fields, and relationship limits; group sparse fields gain `versions` | #1780, #1795, and #1796 | `48d04e0b`; #1795 at `229dc07c`, landed as `5bf2d154`, adds two propagated group-field GETs; #1796 at `8b4821a4`, landed as `48e0d003`, adds the three app and CI-product transports |
| Review submission reads | Review-item sparse fields and includes gain `inAppPurchaseVersion`, `subscriptionVersion`, and `subscriptionGroupVersion` | #1781 | `aba35e0a`; all four changed GET surfaces, automatic item inclusion, and response round-trip tests |
| Pricing reads | Price-point sparse fields gain `adjustedEqualizations`; existing equalization and price-point relationship operations gain `filter[upfrontPricePointId]` and `filter[planType]` where allowed | #1778 and #1795 | `39284b0a` adds endpoint-specific filters, strict CSV/enums, territory inclusion, opaque-next, ID validation, and aggregation; #1795 final head `229dc07c`, landed as `5bf2d154`, adds the propagated sparse-field transports |
| Age rating reads and update | Age-rating sparse fields and update schema gain `socialMedia` and `socialMediaAgeRestricted` | #1778, #1792, and #1796 | `39284b0a` added the fields and CLI behavior; #1792 at `3f7d1449`, landed as `804624cd`, adds omit/value/null encoding; #1796 at `8b4821a4`, landed as `48e0d003`, completes direct and included sparse-query transport |

| Included-resource unions | IAP, subscription, group, and review-submission responses gain their corresponding version resource discriminators | #1777, #1779, #1780, #1781 | `ee40c7b3`, `c8f3ab52`, `48d04e0b`, `aba35e0a`; typed response and included-resource tests |

No existing operation changes from nondeprecated to `deprecated: true` in the
OpenAPI JSON. Forty-four operations instead reverse `deprecated: true` from the
original 4.4 snapshot, primarily screenshot and preview resources. Separately,
Apple's prose release notes deprecate the seven version-replaced resource
families below without setting new operation-level flags. Deprecation behavior
therefore cannot be inferred solely from OpenAPI flags.

## Added and modified schema ledger

Schema discovery and drift enforcement are implemented in #1776 at
`aaa9b62d`: create/update request relationships are exposed through `asc schema`,
referenced relationship schemas are resolved recursively, and both generated
indexes fail their tests when stale.

The 47 added schemas break down into:

- 18 IAP schemas: version resources/linkages/responses, localization v2 CRUD
  requests/responses, and image v2 CRUD/upload requests/responses.
- 18 subscription schemas: version resources/linkages/responses, localization
  v2 CRUD requests/responses, and image v2 CRUD/upload requests/responses.
- 11 subscription-group schemas: version resources/linkages/responses and
  localization v2 CRUD requests/responses.

The exact 61-schema modified-contract checklist is split by whether code work
remained at the immediate pre-PR base.

### Exact modified-operation checklist

This checklist contains exactly the 102 operations whose path-item operation
objects differ between 4.4 and 4.4.1: 50 behavior changes that remained at the
immediate pre-PR base plus 52 changes already reconciled after the 4.4 import.
Schema-mediated request-contract changes are listed separately after it and do
not alter this count.

Age rating and app info (#1778 at `39284b0a` covers response decoding and
update behavior; #1796 final head `8b4821a4`, landed as `48e0d003`, covers
exact sparse-query transport, CLI flags, and query-cardinality tests):

- [x] `GET /v1/appInfoLocalizations/{id}`
- [x] `GET /v1/appInfos/{id}`
- [x] `GET /v1/appInfos/{id}/ageRatingDeclaration`
- [x] `GET /v1/appInfos/{id}/appInfoLocalizations`
- [x] `GET /v1/apps`
- [x] `GET /v1/apps/{id}`
- [x] `GET /v1/apps/{id}/appInfos`
- [x] `GET /v1/ciProducts/{id}/app`

IAP and promoted-purchase propagation (#1777 at `ee40c7b3` plus #1793 final
head `917d719d`, landed as `f6b34d9e`; endpoint-exact query and response
compatibility tests). #1793 closes 11 of the 13 GETs below while preserving
the two top-level IAP list/detail behaviors from #1777:

- [x] `GET /v1/apps/{id}/inAppPurchasesV2`
- [x] `GET /v1/inAppPurchaseAppStoreReviewScreenshots/{id}`
- [x] `GET /v1/inAppPurchaseContents/{id}`
- [x] `GET /v1/inAppPurchaseImages/{id}`
- [x] `GET /v1/inAppPurchaseLocalizations/{id}`
- [x] `GET /v1/promotedPurchases/{id}`
- [x] `GET /v2/inAppPurchases/{id}`
- [x] `GET /v2/inAppPurchases/{id}/appStoreReviewScreenshot`
- [x] `GET /v2/inAppPurchases/{id}/content`
- [x] `GET /v2/inAppPurchases/{id}/images`
- [x] `GET /v2/inAppPurchases/{id}/inAppPurchaseLocalizations`
- [x] `GET /v2/inAppPurchases/{id}/promotedPurchase`
- [x] `GET /v1/apps/{id}/promotedPurchases`

Review submissions (#1781 at `aba35e0a`; exact sparse-field/include tests plus
`links`, `included`, and `meta` response round trips):

- [x] `GET /v1/reviewSubmissions`
- [x] `GET /v1/reviewSubmissions/{id}`
- [x] `GET /v1/reviewSubmissions/{id}/items`
- [x] `GET /v1/apps/{id}/reviewSubmissions`

Review-item includes are exhaustive for the endpoint. Sparse fields for related
resources are exact for the 4.4.1 delta, but ten older related-resource sparse
groups remain outside this slice: `appStoreVersions`,
`appCustomProductPageVersions`, `appStoreVersionExperiments`, `appEvents`,
`backgroundAssetVersions`, and five Game Center resource groups. The API has no
review-item detail GET; deprecated detail stubs therefore remain explicit
errors. Item PATCH preserves nullable `resolved` and `removed` without adding a
confirmation prompt, while submission PATCH preserves nullable `platform`,
`submitted`, and `canceled` and still requires confirmation. Create targets are
restricted to the exact version resource types. The pre-existing submission-
create command still requires a concrete platform even though the schema
permits omission or `null`; changing that stable behavior is outside this
compatibility slice.

Subscriptions, groups, and pricing (#1778 at `39284b0a`, #1779 at `c8f3ab52`,
PR `#1780` at `48d04e0b`, and #1795 final head `229dc07c`, landed as `5bf2d154`;
endpoint-exact query, response, compatibility, and opaque-pagination tests):

- [x] `GET /v1/subscriptionGroupLocalizations/{id}`

### Schema-mediated operation-contract checklist

These 71 operations do not appear in the 102-operation path-item diff because
their operation objects are byte-for-byte unchanged. They reference one or
more of the 61 modified schemas, so their effective request or response
contracts still change. Two have modified request contracts and all 71 have
modified response contracts. Together with the 102 directly modified
operations, they produce 173 unique operation-contract audit items.

Behavior work remaining at the immediate pre-PR base (40), now reconciled.
`PATCH /v1/ageRatingDeclarations/{id}` is covered by #1778 at `39284b0a`;
review-submission item request/response changes are covered by #1781 at
`aba35e0a`; IAP, subscription, and group response propagation is covered by
PR `#1777` at `ee40c7b3`, #1779 at `c8f3ab52`, and #1780 at `48d04e0b`. Checked
response-only operations retain their existing command semantics and decode the
expanded typed relationships without introducing a new flag or ID contract.

## Deprecation and migration ledger

Apple deprecates seven resource families in the prose release notes:

| Deprecated family | Replacement API and implemented command | Owner | Compatibility and warning status | Transition evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IAP localizations v1 | `/v2/inAppPurchaseLocalizations`; `asc iap versions localizations ... --version-id` | #1777, #1786 | Four stable leaves preserved with one exact warning and DEPRECATED direct help | CRUD/ID tests, warning/payload/exit compatibility tests, migration docs |
| IAP images v1 | `/v2/inAppPurchaseImages`; `asc iap versions images ... --version-id` | #1777, #1786 | Five stable leaves preserved with one exact warning and DEPRECATED direct help | Upload characterization, reserve/upload/commit tests, migration docs |
| IAP submissions | `/v1/reviewSubmissionItems`; `asc review items add --item-type inAppPurchaseVersions` | #1777, #1781, #1786, #1787 | Stable submit leaf warns, remains directly callable, and is visible in parent help | Exact relationship payload, warning/exit tests, rendered-help regression |
| Subscription localizations v1 | `/v2/subscriptionLocalizations`; `asc subscriptions versions localizations ... --version-id` | #1779, #1786 | Five stable leaves and one experimental `sync` leaf preserved with exact warnings | CRUD/ID, warning/payload/exit, and migration-doc tests |
| Subscription images v1 | `/v2/subscriptionImages`; `asc subscriptions versions images ... --version-id` | #1779, #1786 | Five stable leaves preserved with exact warnings | Upload characterization, reserve/upload/commit, and migration-doc tests |
| Subscription-group localizations v1 | `/v2/subscriptionGroupLocalizations`; `asc subscriptions groups versions localizations ... --version-id` | #1780, #1786 | Five stable leaves and one experimental `sync` leaf preserved with exact warnings | CRUD/ID, warning/payload/exit, and migration-doc tests |
| Subscription and group submissions | `/v1/reviewSubmissionItems`; item types `subscriptionVersions` and `subscriptionGroupVersions` | #1781, #1786 | Two stable submit leaves preserved with exact warnings and DEPRECATED direct help | Relationship payload, warning/exit, and migration-doc tests |

PR `#1786` begins the repository's required deprecation window for 29 public leaves:
27 stable and two experimental `sync` commands. `asc iap setup` and
`asc subscriptions setup` remain stable but emit one combined warning when
legacy localization flags are requested. All 33 exported legacy client methods
carry precise Go `Deprecated:` replacement documentation. The wrapper preserves
flags, endpoint selection, stdout, confirmation requirements, and exit behavior
while writing one migration warning to stderr.

No stable behavior was deleted. Removal requires a later release after the
documented deprecation window; this goal intentionally stops before release.

15. Subscription localization delete-confirmation coverage was audited at
    #1790 head `49eda126` and landed as `73466720`; it is test-only.
16. Hardened public 4.4.1 command workflows were audited at #1791 head
    `e9c2a0dc` and landed as `e902d375`; that docs-only commit became the base
    for #1792.
17. #1792 completed all seven nullable request properties at exact final head
    `3f7d14495fcb3b696692bee4955e36fd2f36c63f` and landed on `main` as
    `804624cd158d1eb8843d8e0be7cf55bc639da0a1`.
18. #1793 completed the IAP and promoted-purchase related sparse-field follow-up
    at exact final head `917d719df73a8dce9eefd5f378bad5a0562a67c0`
    and landed on `main` as `f6b34d9e042964673ee39c32fbae4f7aa99fc874`.
19. External workflow skills were first audited through
    rorkai/app-store-connect-cli-skills#51 at exact head
    `d7888b2b4a1a152f8524fc18c99d2d73d1c431fc`. The final cross-repository
    audit found one invalid combined Xcode help path; skills #52 fixed it at
    exact head `1aeb0dc607d8fa327501bc4b1d1cf981448512f9` and landed as skills `main`
    `f8f43c29d96a85792b99a8a1f23a7f048f8b312d`. CodeRabbit and Cursor Bugbot
    passed, the PR had zero review threads, all 23 skill validators passed, and
    all 695 runnable command occurrences validated against CLI `48e0d003`.
20. #1795 completed the subscription and pricing related sparse-field follow-up
    at exact final head `229dc07c3b999777e9b03dd543f66c3c6898e705`
    and landed on `main` as `5bf2d1545785a863242a8509bf55cc25d8a4ab49`.
21. #1796 completed the app-info, age-rating, and Xcode Cloud sparse-field
    follow-up at exact final head
    `8b4821a4529ae3a257dc56945a67dbef0ab7ac6b` and landed on `main` as
    `48e0d003ebde8d2046b0a19463526c95c3bc25e4`; all four review threads are
    resolved.
22. Exact CLI `main` `48e0d003` is the fully merged behavior integration through
    #1796. Its PR gates and post-merge Main Branch, Govulncheck, and CodeQL
    workflows passed. The historical built-help audit through #1788 found 48
    added and 52 changed leaf paths relative to `839c4da6`, with zero removals;
    later flag-level help changes are verified by their focused command tests.
    Those historical counts do not replace #1792's typed nullable-encoding
    tests.

CLI behavior and lifecycle PRs through #1788, the ledger PR, test-only #1790,
docs-only #1791, nullable-fidelity #1792, IAP sparse-field #1793,
subscription/pricing sparse-field #1795, app-info/age-rating/Xcode Cloud
sparse-field #1796, and the companion skills PR are merged. No behavior PR
remains open. No release, tag, or package publication is part of this goal.

### Built help-surface delta

The recursive comparison executes every reachable leaf `--help` path in fresh
binaries built at `839c4da6` and `9282e82d`. It found 48 additions:

There are zero removed leaf paths. `iap submit` remains callable and now appears
in parent help with its DEPRECATED migration text; it is counted as changed,
not removed.

## Mandatory verification for every behavior PR

- Inspect current built `--help` before choosing the command shape.
- Validate the exact operation's request attributes, relationships, filters,
  includes, sparse fields, limits, and response schemas.
- Establish RED CLI tests and HTTP method/path/query/body tests.
- Cover success, required-flag validation, invalid values, API errors, empty
  responses, pagination, and upload/artifact failures where applicable.
- Assert destructive commands require `--confirm` before authentication or
  network side effects.
- Verify JSON and representative table output by structure, not only strings.
- Build a fresh `/tmp/asc` binary and verify stdout, stderr, help, and exit codes.
- Use `ASC_BYPASS_KEYCHAIN=1` for every manual CLI test.
- Run focused tests after each fix, adjacent packages before commit, and then:

```bash
make format
make check-docs
make lint
ASC_BYPASS_KEYCHAIN=1 make test
```

- Prefer read-only live verification. Use disposable app `6759231657` for
  mutations, record created IDs, clean them up, and report leftovers.
- Re-query the latest PR head, thread-aware reviews, required checks, and
  mergeability before declaring a slice ready.

## Final omission audit

The final closeout on exact CLI `main` `48e0d003` independently repeated these
checks rather than trusting the per-PR reports. Historical evidence is labelled
separately from the final sparse-query, nullable-fidelity, and live checks:

- [x] Re-downloaded Apple's official OpenAPI zip and verified the artifact and
  extracted JSON hashes against the repository snapshot.
- [x] Recomputed the 4.4-to-4.4.1 delta: 37 paths, 47 added operations, 47 added
  schemas, zero removals, 102 directly modified operations, and 61 modified
  schemas.
- [x] Mapped all 47 added operations to exact HTTP method/path tests and
  discoverable typed command/client surfaces.
- [x] Classified all 102 direct plus 71 transitive operation-contract changes:
  173 unique existing-operation contracts with no missing or extra ledger item.
- [x] Closed all 50 directly modified sparse-query transports: 14 were already
  handled before the hard follow-up; #1793 added 11 IAP/promoted-purchase
  transports, #1795 added 17 subscription/pricing transports, and #1796 added
  eight app-info/age-rating/Xcode Cloud transports. The final matrix has zero
  missing or extra operations.
- [x] On #1792 final head `3f7d1449`, landed as `804624cd`, mapped all 47 added and 61
  modified schemas to typed models, documented generic decoding, or an
  already-reconciled schema-only disposition. This includes table-driven
  omission/value/null encoding for the seven nullable properties missed by the
  earlier merged closeout.
- [x] Mapped all nine release-note additions and seven deprecated families to
  commands, compatibility treatment, tests, and migration guidance.
- [x] The historical built-help comparison through #1788 exercised all 100
  paths changed in that slice: 48 additions and 52 changes, with zero removals.
  Later sparse-field flag changes were verified by their focused exact-help and
  generated-command-doc tests; the historical 100-path count is not presented
  as a final flag-level delta.
- [x] Sequentially merged all 13 exact audited CLI heads through #1788,
  producing `main` `9282e82d`; its integration, Govulncheck, and CodeQL
  workflows passed.
- [x] #1792 merged from exact final head
  `3f7d14495fcb3b696692bee4955e36fd2f36c63f` and landed on `main` as
  `804624cd158d1eb8843d8e0be7cf55bc639da0a1`.
- [x] Deprecated all 29 public legacy leaves with one exact warning and direct
  migration help, added conditional setup warnings, and documented all 33
  exported legacy client methods without deleting stable behavior.
- [x] Exercised all 47 added operations against live App Store Connect on app
  `6759231657`, including reserve/upload/commit/delete image lifecycles and
  version/localization mutations.
- [x] Recorded live schema differences: adjusted-equalization prerequisites,
  age-rating dependencies, and Apple's rejection of empty/null v2 localization
  descriptions.
- [x] Verified validator v1 reads see v2-created resources with identical IDs;
  no runtime validator migration was needed.
- [x] Cleaned every disposable resource the API permits and recorded the three
  unavoidable version/localization remnant pairs. All four review submissions
  are empty and age-rating fields were restored.
- [x] Audited and merged companion workflow-skills PR #51, then closed the one
  remaining invalid combined Xcode help path in PR #52 at exact head
  `1aeb0dc607d8fa327501bc4b1d1cf981448512f9`, producing skills `main`
  `f8f43c29d96a85792b99a8a1f23a7f048f8b312d`. PR #52 had zero review threads;
  CodeRabbit and Cursor Bugbot passed; all 23 validators and 695 runnable command
  occurrences passed against CLI `48e0d003`. No runnable deprecated localization
  or submission teaching remains.
- [x] Ran the final read-only live smoke with the exact-`main` `48e0d003` CLI on
  disposable app `6759231657`: the app read succeeded, all four age fields were
  `false`, every one of the four review submissions returned no items, all six
  retained resources remained readable, and all deleted parents and containers
  remained not found. This read-only smoke is not evidence that Apple accepts
  explicit null for #1792's seven corrected fields.
- [x] Confirmed the fully merged behavior integration through #1796, `main`
  `48e0d003`, follows green exact-head and post-merge Main Branch, Govulncheck,
  and CodeQL workflows; #1789 previously landed the ledger at `d6d8d94b`,
  test-only #1790 landed at `73466720`, docs-only #1791 landed at `e902d375`,
  nullable-fidelity #1792 landed at `804624cd`, IAP sparse-field #1793 landed at
  `f6b34d9e`, and subscription/pricing sparse-field #1795 landed at `5bf2d154`.
  Skills `main` `f8f43c29d96a85792b99a8a1f23a7f048f8b312d` is the landed
  companion-skills integration; its final PR's CodeRabbit and Cursor Bugbot
  checks passed. The latest release/tag remains
  `3.0.0` at the pre-integration commit `839c4da6`. No release, tag,
  Homebrew/WinGet update, or package publication was performed.
